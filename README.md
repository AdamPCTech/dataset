jQuery.Dataset
==============

# About

jQuery dataset is a jquery plugin that handles client side dataset management. It is entirely separate from any sort of UI for a reason. It's meant to function as a layer on top of which tools such as data visualization libraries can be written with a separation of concerns between the data and ui.

# Status

Currently, the spec for the library is being written.
See jquery.dataet.js for the spec. In the future, this will contain the proper library and this file will contain the spec. For the sake of allowing comments on code lines, we're keeping it as a src file in github.
